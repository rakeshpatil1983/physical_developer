# Physical Developer
Physical developer is a project to build anything from Electronics, Electrical, Mechanical and Chemical compositions together like a real project and validate it completely in a software virtual environment. 
Imagine this like developing and testing in a real life environment but actually happeing inside a software. 

# Uses
All the costs and efforts in developing and testing in a real time environment then again going back and prototyping and testing all these iterations will be completely ZERO.
The cost of all development, prototyping and testing will all happen in  one single software.

# Modules
This list keeps on Growing as the development progresses.
- Mechanical CAD Designer
- Electronics CAD Designer
- Electronics Simulator
- Software Programming module for various microcontrollers, processors etc
- FEM for Mechanical, Chemical, Magnetic and Electro simulations and visualizations
- Chemical Designers and simulators
- Atom and Quantum level simulators


# Status
This is just begun and any updates will follow here.
